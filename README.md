# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This repository contains web servicing processes, along with the first level
API backend (relating to Create Read Update Delete operations). Primary considerations
are production pipelining, SSL security, static asset hosting (the app), and server-side (pre)rendering.

The parenthetical nature of these processes should be ephemeral and cost effective.

Please consider the following stack abstracts:

## S3 Bucket / Static Hosting

## Lambda Operations: APIs

## Lambda Operations: Server-Side (Pre)Rendering

## Certificate Management

## CI/CD

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
